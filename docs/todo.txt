Java:

J1, Merge the code to the package. Make sure the project compiles. All algorithms should compile to a single .jar file for the python APIs.
	a. Algorithm to edu.ucr.cs.pyneapple.regionalization. The class should implement the RegionalizationMethod interface and override the interface functions
	b. Utilities classes to edu.ucr.cs.pyneapple.utils
	c. Test cases to test\java\edu\ucr\cs\pyneapple\regionalization. Please make sure the test cases follow the junit.framework.TestCase format.
J2, Write javadoc documentation for the public functions

Python:
P1, Confirm the documentation of the Python APIs and move the files to the corresponding directory
	a. The .py files for the python APIs should be under Pyneapple/Python/regionalization
	b. The test cases in Pyneapple/Python/tests, the file name should be test_xxx.py
P2, Make sure the functions can be called by regionalization.xxx when the module is imported. 
	Make sure that the notebooks under /notebooks can run online in the binder environment. The packages should be imported as pyneapple.regionalization.xxx
	If the binder takes too long to load, please try to run the notebook after installing the package after installing the package by running
	pip install .
	at the root directory or
	pip install git+https://github.com/MagdyLab/Pyneapple.git@main
